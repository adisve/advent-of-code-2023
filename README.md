# Advent of Code - Go Edition

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges for 2023. I'm using this as an opportunity to learn [Go](https://golang.org/), so the code is probably not idiomatic Go and could be further improved.

## Running

To run the code, you'll need to have Go installed. Then, you can run the code for a given day with:

```
go run day01/main.go
```
